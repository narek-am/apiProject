    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/api-testing-framework.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd apiProject
    ```
3. Install the required Python packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Optional: Install Allure command-line tools for generating allure reports. [Allure Installation Guide](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_installing_a_commandline)


## Running Tests

To run all the tests, simply execute the `main.py` file.

```bash
python main.py
```

Alternatively, you can run specific tests using `pytest`.

```bash
pytest tests/test_google_maps_api.py
```

## Utility Modules

- `api.py`: Contains generic API request methods.
- `checking.py`: For all your validation needs.
- `http_method.py`: Enumerations for HTTP methods.
- `logger.py`: Logging utilities.
